# Proof Declaration

## Sealed Proof Artifact

**Date:** 2026-02-11
**Status:** Sealed (immutable)
**Evidence Quality:** High (dual-track: success + limitations)

This repository is a sealed proof artifact. It documents observed results demonstrating that execution boundaries can function under specific conditions.

---

## Important Notice

This repository is not an implementation, not a product, and not an enforcement mechanism. It provides no runtime guarantees, safety guarantees, or compliance claims. It does not prevent misuse, accidents, or harm by itself.

All code, logs, screenshots, and diagrams exist as evidence for proof purposes only. Any operational enforcement must be implemented outside this repository.

This proof demonstrates that AI execution can be stopped before side effects occur under controlled conditions. It does not claim universal applicability, safety certification, or production readiness.

Success evidence and documented limitations are treated as equal components of this proof. Questions, discussions, and critical review are welcome via GitHub Issues.

## What This Proof Is

- Observed demonstration that judgment can precede execution structurally
- Evidence that execution can be prevented before side effects occur
- Sealed evidence bundle showing both success cases and documented limitations
- Reproducible test case under specific controlled conditions

---

## What This Proof Is Not

- Production-ready solution
- Security control or safety system
- Policy enforcement engine
- Compliance certification
- Telegram bot framework or template
- Universal guarantee for all scenarios

---

## ALLOW Outcomes Clarification

This repository contains STOP, HOLD, and ALLOW outcomes. None of these outcomes constitute safety guarantees or execution justification.

**ALLOW is not a safety judgment.** ALLOW outcomes are distinguished by decision path (safe_pattern, no_rules_triggered, ambiguous) for audit traceability and accountability, not for runtime execution control.

Path metadata enables post-hoc analysis of false negatives, true negatives, and ambiguous cases without altering execution behavior.

---

## Honesty in Engineering

This repository includes **both success and limitation evidence**.

Most demonstrations hide failures. This proof documents them proactively.

**Why?**
- Prevents misinterpretation of claims
- Establishes credibility through transparency
- Shows what's proven vs what's next

Evidence, not marketing.

---

## Purpose

**The purpose of this repository is not to permit execution more effectively, but to structurally reveal when execution is not justified.**

This proof is sealed as dual-track evidence: success cases and failure/limitation cases are documented with equal rigor.

Future rule additions, judgment improvements, or blocking enhancements are outside the scope of this repository.
